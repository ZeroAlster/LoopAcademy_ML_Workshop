This repository is related to Machine Learning Workshop projects held by loop academy under the supervision of Amir Hosein Hadian Rasanan.[Loop Academy](http://loopacademy.io/).


## Project 1 : Classification task for Echocardiogram Data Set 

In this project the goal is to find out if the person survive or not according to  the proposed dataset. 
Data for classifying if patients will survive for at least one year after a heart attack is given and we are going to create pipline for this problem; starting from preprocessing tasks( like normalization,standardization ,...) to creating KNN model for the problem and evaluate our method. The link to the dataset and important notes about it is [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/echocardiogram). I also write as many as comments for each section of this first project in the jupter notebook.
